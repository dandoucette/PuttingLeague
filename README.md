Disc Golf Putting League WPF app

A simple app to keep track of rounds of a disc golf putting league.  I haven't coded in WPF in awhile so doing some less than ideal easy things.  Could probably be way easier if I had a user control array or figure out how to access my controls with a string I could build but not for now.  Step 1 - get it working, step 2 - make the code better and add features.

This app needs to be self contained so I'll be storing data locally.
